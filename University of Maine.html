<h2> Where I am At Now: </h2>

<P> Currently I am a redshirt freshman in his first off season as a Division 1 football player. This past Fall I did not travel or dress for games I did practice and Lift every day though as apart of the redshirt program.
This season I was apart of the best football team in Maine history we won the CAA and advanced to the Semi-Final playoff game. It was an unbelievable expierence to have been there every step of the way and help the starters by running scout team and making them better.
I couldnt have asked for a better freshman year and now its time to earn my spot on the feild. </P>
