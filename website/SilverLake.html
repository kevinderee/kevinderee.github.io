<p> Silverlake is a public high school located in Kingston Massachussetts. The high school is made up of three towns, Kingston, Plympton, and Halifax.
Which is where I grew up. My two oldest brothers attended Silverlake where they graduated and both played Basketball. I attended Silverlake for my freshman
    and sophomore year and played one year of varsity football when I was a sophomore. I started on both offense and defense and had a great first half of the season until I was injured and could not play for the remainder of the season.
After that season I was given the opportunity to attend Thayer Academy a Private school 45 minutes away from my home and play football in what was said to be the toughest high school league in Massachussetts for football.</p>
